## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) (version 20.0.2)
- npm or yarn package manager

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd schoolmgt
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## 💻 Development

### Starting the Development Server

Launch the development server:
```bash
ng serve
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:4200/`. The app automatically reloads when you make changes to the source files.

### Code Generation

Angular CLI provides powerful scaffolding tools:

```bash
# Generate a new component
ng generate component component-name

# Generate a service
ng generate service service-name

# Generate a module
ng generate module module-name

# View all available schematics
ng generate --help
```

## 🏗️ Building for Production

Create a production build:
```bash
ng build
```

Build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, optimized for performance and ready for deployment.

## 🧪 Testing

### Unit Tests
Run unit tests using Karma test runner:
```bash
ng test
```

### End-to-End Tests
Execute e2e tests:
```bash
ng e2e
```

*Note: Angular CLI doesn't include an e2e testing framework by default. Choose one that fits your project needs.*
